Visualize research topics across [Scopus subject area classifications](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14882/supporthub/scopus/~/what-are-the-most-frequent-subject-area-categories-and-classifications-used-in/).


## Prerequisites
- You have a GitHub account
- You have access to Scopus through an institution, which allows you a Scopus API Key (which you can acquire [here](https://dev.elsevier.com/)) and an  [Insttoken](https://dev.elsevier.com/support.html); you will need to [contact Elsevier Support via email for an Insttoken](https://service.elsevier.com/app/contact/supporthub/dataasaservice/).

## Installation
These installation instructions were written for macOS but should be roughly applicable on other Unix-based operating systems.


### Install Node.js and npm
First, install nvm (node version manager):
```
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

# Set NVM_DIR variable
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"

# Load nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

Close your terminal session and open a new one, then use nvm to install node:
```
# Install node 12.7.0
nvm install node 12.7.0

# Add `nvm use` directive to ~/.zshrc
echo 'nvm use 12.7.0' >> ~/.zshrc

# Apply edited ~/.zshrc directives without having to restart your terminal
source ~/.zshrc
```


### Install or Update [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

**Install:**
ref: https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/3.html
```sh
# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Add Homebrew to your PATH in ~/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

**Update:**
```sh
$ brew update
```


### Install other dependencies
Use Homebrew to install Python 3.10, PostgreSQL 12, and other backend dependencies:
```
# Install dependencies
$ brew install python@3.10 postgresql@12 gdal redis openssl pipenv gh
$ brew services start postgresql@12
$ brew services start redis

# Add Postgresql 12 to your PATH in ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@12/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Apply edited ~/.zshrc directives without having to restart your terminal
source ~/.zshrc
```
_Note_: `gh` is the GitHub CLI, which you may or may not already have installed. If you're already set up to interact with github.com from your command line, great! If not, use `gh auth login` and follow the prompts to login in to your GitHub account so that you can clone the source code repository.


### Create Database
Create a PostgreSQL database named "resviz"
```
# Create database
createdb resviz

# Make sure you can connect to the database
psql resviz

# Use "\q" to exit the psql interface after successfully connecting
```


### Clone Source Code Repository
Navigate to the directory on your local machine where you want to house the source code repository. Clone the source code repository into this location using `git clone`. See the above note about `gh` if you're having trouble authenticating with GitHub.
```
git clone https://github.com/bcarradini/research-visualizer.git
```


### Create Python Virtual Environment
Navigate to the root of the local source code repository and create Python virtual environment.
```
# Install pipenv
pip3 install pipenv

# Create Python 3 virtual environment
pipenv --python 3.10

# Activate virtual environment
pipenv shell
```
_Note_: From here on out, you should assume that any instructions should be carried out **only after** you have navigated to the root of the local source code repository and activated the virtual environment


### Install project dependencies
Navigate to the root of the local source code repository, then install project dependencies:
```
# Activate virtual environment (if you haven't done so already)
pipenv shell

# From within the activated virtual environment, install Python dependencies
pipenv install

# From within the activated virtual environment, install Node dependencies
npm install
```


### Create Local Settings
Navigate to the root of the local source code repository, then create a file called `local_settings.py` inside of the `project` directory. This is a _secret file_ that will not be tracked by source code versioning. It is used to store secret keys and should look like this, where `YOUR_SCOPUS_API_KEY` and `YOUR_SCOPUS_INST_TOKEN` are placeholders:
```
import os

os.environ['SCOPUS_API_KEY'] = 'YOUR_SCOPUS_API_KEY'
os.environ['SCOPUS_INST_TOKEN'] = 'YOUR_SCOPUS_INST_TOKEN'
```
_Note_: Both the Scopus API Key and the Insttoken are expected to be 32-character hex strings (e.g. "0123456789ab4567cdef0123456789yz")


### Populate Database
Navigate to the root of the local source code repository, then:
```
# Activate virtual environment (if you haven't done so already)
pipenv shell

# Migrate the database to setup required tables and relationships
python manage.py migrate
```
Now, populate the database with information about Scopus Sources (journals) and Classification codes by following these instructions:
1. Download the latest scopus source list from https://www.scopus.com, which will be an Excel spreadsheet.
2. Convert the first tab of the spreadsheet (e.g. "Scopus Sources October 2021") to CSV format.
3. Place CSV file at `visualizer/static/data/scopus_sources.csv` within the local source code repository.
4. Execute script from within the local source code repository: `python manage.py populate_database --execute`.
5. If the script cannot parse the CSV file:
  a. Make sure the constants defined at the top of the `populate_database` script still align with the column names in the latest source list.
  b. Make sure the `encoding` specified when opening the CSV file aligns with how the CSV file was generated (utf-8? utf-8-sig? etc).

_Note_: The above instructions are also available by executing `python manage.py populate_database --help`


## Run

Navigate to the root of the local source code repository, then start the HTTP server:
```
# Activate virtual environment (if you haven't done so already)
pipenv shell

# Start the HTTP server using the "go" executable, which is a wrapper for "gunicorn project.wsgi -b localhost:5001 --reload"
./go
```

In a _separate_ terminal, navigate to the root of the local source code repository, then start the async worker process:
```
# Activate virtual environment (if you haven't done so already)
pipenv shell

# Start the async worker process
./worker.py
```

Once the HTTP server is running and the worker is running, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5001/ to access the front page of the research visualizer.


## Troubleshoot

### Worker process crashes when search job is queued
This is what it looks like:
```
objc[61078]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.
objc[61078]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
```
This is how to workaround the problem:
```
# Edit ~/.zshrc
echo 'export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES' >> ~/.zshrc

# Apply edited ~/.zshrc directives without having to restart your terminal
source ~/.zshrc
```
